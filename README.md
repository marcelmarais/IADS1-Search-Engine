# Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures - *A Search Engine for a Large Text Corpus*

The instruction sheet for this coursework can be found in `/docs`. But consisted of the tasks below:

1. Compiling an index for a large collection of documents using a file-based version of **MergeSort**.
2. Using such an index to process **search queries**. For example, it should be possible to search for all places within the text corpus where at least two of the words friends, romans, countrymen appear within the space of 5 lines.
3. Reducing the size of the in-memory component of the index as far as possible, using a ***perfect hashing*** scheme due to Belazzougui, Botelho and Dietzfelbinger (2008).

> My solution to this coursework attained a grade of **85% (A2)**
